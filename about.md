Hi,

I'm a software developer at [Nop-Templates](http://www.nop-templates.com/). I've been passionate about programming and problem solving since elementary school. I've always been fan of self educating. 

When I'm not tweaking at something you could find me at the gym, hanging out with friends or just reading a good book.
